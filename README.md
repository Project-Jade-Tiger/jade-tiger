## ACCTMIS 4630 Semester Project

In this semester-long project, students will embark on a journey to create a collaborative coding companion application that leverages the powerful features of Visual Studio Code (VS Code) and GitHub. Are you tired of your code crying in the corner, feeling lonely and unloved? Say goodbye to solo coding blues with GitHugs! Picture this: a semester project that's more fun than a barrel of monkeys (minus the mess). Welcome to the wild world of app development, where VS Code and GitHub become your trusty sidekicks in a quest for coding greatness!

Imagine a virtual buddy that's always there to lend a helping hand, pat you on the back, or gently nudge you when you're about to make a catastrophic coding catastrophe. GitHugs is like having a coding mentor who moonlights as your best friend and confidant.
